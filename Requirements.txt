***Requirements (Windows)***:

Operating System: Windows 10 or higher.

Compiler: MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) or any GCC-compatible compiler.

Download and install MinGW: MinGW Installation Guide.
Ensure gcc is added to the system PATH during installation.

Network Configuration:
Ensure localhost (127.0.0.1) is accessible.
Configure the firewall to allow communication on the chosen port (e.g., port 12345).รง
                
Required Files:
client.c (Client source code).
server.c (Server source code).
encryption.c (Encryption implementation).
encryption.h (Encryption function declarations).
              
Compilation Instructions:
Compile encryption.c:
gcc -c encryption.c -o encryption.o
              
Compile and link the server:
gcc -o server.exe server.c encryption.o -lws2_32
              
Compile and link the client:
gcc -o client.exe client.c encryption.o -lws2_32
              
Execution Instructions:
Start the server:
server.exe
Start the client in another terminal:
client.exe
              
Libraries:
Winsock library is required and linked with the -lws2_32 flag during compilation.

***Requirements (macOS)***:

Operating System: macOS (any modern version supporting GCC and the POSIX API).

Compiler: GCC (installed via Xcode Command Line Tools).

Install with:
xcode-select --install
              
Network Configuration:
Ensure that localhost (127.0.0.1) is accessible.
Open necessary ports if testing across a network (e.g., port 12345 for this project).
                                                  
Required Files:
client.c (Client source code).
server.c (Server source code).
encryption.c (Encryption implementation).
encryption.h (Encryption function declarations).
              
Compilation Instructions:
Compile encryption.c:
gcc -c encryption.c -o encryption.o
              
Compile and link the server:
gcc -o server server.c encryption.o
              
Compile and link the client:
gcc -o client client.c encryption.o
              
Execution Instructions:
Start the server:
./server
              
Start the client in another terminal:
./client
